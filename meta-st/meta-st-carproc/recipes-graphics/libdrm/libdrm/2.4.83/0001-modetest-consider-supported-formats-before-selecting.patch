Subject: [PATCH 1/6] modetest: consider supported formats before selecting a
 DRM plane

This fixes an issue where the DRM planes do not support the same pixel
formats.
The current implementation selects a DRM plane without checking whether
the pixel format is supported or not. As a consequence modetest may try
to set up a plane not supporting the user request-format, which fails.
Modetest has to check the supported formats accross the plane list before
selecting a candidate.
